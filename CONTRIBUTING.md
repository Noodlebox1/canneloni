# Contributing notes
- There are 2 list files. [`list.txt`](/lists/list.txt) is a simple list of all blacklisted email domains, while [`comment-list.txt`](/lists/comment-list.txt) also contains comments on which website was used to generate them. **Please add the site used to make the email to `commentlist.txt` in the existing style**
- If there is a typo in an address, please file an issue (or make a PR and fix it yourself!)
- Before you add an email domain, **please check that it has not allready been added (using ctrl+F or similar)!**
- No need to make a new branch when you fork. Keep it as main.
- Don't remove an email domain from the list without first making an issue

Thanks for contributing, your support means the world!
